## Lost key
---
> *A small, enigmatic Python process was left running on an old machine in the corner of a long-abandoned data center. When executed, it demands a password to unlock a hidden message. But the password itself? Nowhere to be found—at least, not where one would expect.
> The few who dared to investigate this strange file reported catching only fleeting glimpses of something—a brief, ghostly hint within the program’s own depths, as if the answer exists only as a fading echo.
> Perhaps, if you capture the process in just the right way, you may unveil the lost key. But beware: some secrets are hidden in places that software rarely lingers.*

### Solution:
A simple yet effective technique to bypass a program's verification process by performing a memory dump. This process captures the Python memory state, potentially revealing sensitive data, like loaded passwords, that can leak due to insufficient obfuscation or protection within the program’s memory.
