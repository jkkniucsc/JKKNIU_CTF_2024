## Shadow Mind

> During a midnight sweep of an abandoned research facility, a flash drive was found clutched in the hand of a fallen operative. 
> Its only contents? A zipped archive labeled `Shadow_mind.zip.` Cryptic as it sounds, initial attempts to access the archive 
> revealed it’s locked—no ordinary password seems to open it. But maybe there’s a hidden logic in the label `******` that holds the 
> key to unlocking the archive’s secrets.
> Inside, you’ll uncover the shadowed profiles of two unknown figures. Each of these identities is protected by hardened credentials, locked behind complex hashes. Only by decrypting these hashes can you reveal the true nature of their access, and perhaps, piece together what they left behind.
> The stakes are high, and the solution lies buried in layers of encryption. Crack the shadows to unearth the truth—if you can.
