## Shadow Mind

> During a midnight sweep of an abandoned research facility, a flash drive was found clutched in the hand of a fallen operative. 
> Its only contents? A zipped archive labeled `Shadow_mind.zip.` Cryptic as it sounds, initial attempts to access the archive 
> revealed it’s locked—no ordinary password seems to open it. But maybe there’s a hidden logic in the label `******` that holds the 
> key to unlocking the archive’s secrets.
> Inside, you’ll uncover the shadowed profiles of two unknown figures. Each of these identities is protected by hardened credentials, locked behind complex hashes. <br> <br> Only by decrypting these hashes can you reveal the true nature of their access, and perhaps, piece together what they left behind.
> The stakes are high, and the solution lies buried in layers of encryption. Crack the shadows to unearth the truth—if you can.
