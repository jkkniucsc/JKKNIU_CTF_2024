Challenge Description: One of my favorite YouTubers is Jay Foreman(https://www.youtube.com/@JayForeman). He makes videos about world maps. One of my favorite videos is about Bangladesh(https://youtu.be/r-aIzkvPwFo?si=tLGkwaiJ4_KmrGK9). However, Bangladesh is a very polluted country, with dust everywhere.
